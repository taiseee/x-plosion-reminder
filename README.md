# Serverless Framework Python Scheduled Cron on AWS

This template demonstrates how to develop and deploy a simple cron-like service running on AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework.

Detailed information about cron expressions in available in official [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html#CronExpressions).

## Usage

### Deployment

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework dashboard, which includes advanced features such as CI/CD, monitoring, metrics, etc.

In order to deploy with dashboard, you need to first login with:

```
serverless login
```

and then perform deployment with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```
Deploying "aws-python-scheduled-cron" to stage "dev" (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-python-scheduled-cron-dev (146s)

functions:
  rateHandler: aws-python-scheduled-cron-dev-rateHandler (2.2 kB)
```

There is no additional step required. Your defined schedules becomes active right away after deployment.

### Local invocation

In order to test out your functions locally, you can invoke them with the following command:

```
serverless invoke local --function rateHandler
```

After invocation, you should see output similar to:

```
INFO:handler:Your cron function ran at 15:02:43.203145
```

### Bundling dependencies

In case you would like to include 3rd party dependencies, you will need to use a plugin called `serverless-python-requirements`. You can set it up by running the following command:

```
serverless plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements
```

Running the above will automatically add `serverless-python-requirements` to `plugins` section in your `serverless.yml` file and add it as a `devDependency` to `package.json` file. The `package.json` file will be automatically created if it doesn't exist beforehand. Now you will be able to add your dependencies to `requirements.txt` file (`Pipfile` and `pyproject.toml` is also supported but requires additional configuration) and they will be automatically injected to Lambda package during build process. For more details about the plugin's configuration, please refer to [official documentation](https://github.com/UnitedIncome/serverless-python-requirements).
